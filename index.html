    <title>Anime: Is Dub or Sub better?</title>

     <header>
         Why dubbed anime is better than subbed.
    </header>
    <li> It's better because you can watch it while doing other stuff such as cooking, or cleaning</li>
    <li> It's better because you can enjoy the entire experience instead of reading the subtitles; your brain is 100% focused on the anime and not 50%
    on reading and 50% on watching</li>
    <li> English Voice Actors are easier to follow along with what's happening and easier to understand</li>
    <li> Better for binge watching</li>
    <li> Sometimes subtitles don't fully translate correctly or translate text on screen, 
    but with English dub, it translates both voice and text</li>
    <li> Better if you're a slow reader </li>

    Why sub is better:
    - Original voice acting for original experience and culture
    - Content won't be cut for dubbing purposes (Censoring, cutting scenes)
    - Is good if you're learning the language and need to know how it is spoken (slang and formal)
    - Japanese voice actors are more emotional and feel more in-character
    - More accessible and more available varied content
    - Better for recent release and on release watching, can take a while for the English dub to release
